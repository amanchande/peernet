# Peer-net 
Peer-to-peer communication without internet

## Progress till now
A basic application which  can find peers available on the same network (who are using **peernet** app and have their visibility over the network turned on) and connect with them to share a simple message using sockets.

- [x] Display available peers on the same network
- [x] Connect to a particular peer
- [x] Send a simple message from one device
- [x] Recieve message on another device
